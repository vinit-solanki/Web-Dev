      The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to
      Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded
      head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually
      dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent
      mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride
      consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female
      lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion
      is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when
      opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically do
      not actively seek out and prey on humans.

      The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually
      more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being
      active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion
      ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but
      it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and
      one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the
      IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have
      declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are
      untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the
      decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans
      are the greatest causes for concern.
