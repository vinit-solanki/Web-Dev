        <b>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</b> is the standard <a href="">markup
          <br/>language</a> for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.<br />It
          defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted<br />by
          technologies such as <a href=""><i>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</i></a> and scripting<br />languages
          such as JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from<br />local
          storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.<br />HTMLdescribes
          the structure of a web page semantically and<br />originallyincluded cues
          for its appearance.

              <h4>November 24, 1995</h4>
              HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added capabilities:
              <ul>
                <li>November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)</li>
                <li>May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables)</li>
                <li>August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)</li>
                <li>January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)</li>
              </ul>
              <li><h3>HTML 3</h3></li>
        <h4>January 14, 1997</h4>
        <p>HTML 3.2[15] was published as a W3C Recommendation. It was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12, 1996.[16]
          Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two companies.[13] A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was standardized 14 months later in MathML.</p>
          <li><h3>HTML 4</h3></li>
          <h4>May 2000</h4>
          <p>ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup><a>[23]</a></sup> ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01 Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.[24] In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 â€“ Document description and processing languages).[23]
            After HTML 4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the W3C's HTML Working Group.</p>
